# gulp-choose-file [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gulp-choose-file.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-choose-file) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/gulp-choose-file.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/gulp-choose-file)

Gulp plugin that prompts you to choose a file to pass through the stream.

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var choose = require('gulp-choose-file');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  return gulp.src('fixtures/*.*')
    .pipe(choose())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('actual'));
});
```

## options.choices

If you need to be able to automatically skip the prompt, you can pass a string with your "choice" to `options.choices`.

The following will only write `a.txt`:

```js
gulp.task('default', function() {
  return gulp.src('fixtures/*.txt')
    .pipe(choose({choices: 'a.txt'}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('actual'));
});
```
